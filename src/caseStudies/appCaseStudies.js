    companyOverview:
      "Open is a modern breathwork, meditation, and mindfulness platform designed to enhance mental well-being through audio, video, and live classes. The app blends ancient practices with contemporary experiences, helping users manage stress, improve sleep, enhance focus, and nurture self-awareness—all from their mobile device. With a visually calming interface and high-quality guided sessions, Open stands out as a lifestyle companion for holistic well-being.",
    objective:
      "Open aimed to position itself not just as a meditation app but as a daily ritual for mindfulness and self-care. The focus was on delivering an immersive user experience, increasing organic discoverability on the App Store, driving user retention, and building a loyal community of mindful users through non-intrusive, content-first marketing.",
    approach: {
      researchStrategy:
        "We began by deep-diving into user behavior in the mindfulness and breathwork space. Our analysis revealed that many existing apps either focused solely on meditation or breathwork but lacked integration of both in a seamless daily routine. We positioned Open as a ‘Hybrid Mindfulness Studio’—bridging guided meditation, breathwork, and music into one unified platform, curated for both beginners and experienced practitioners.",
